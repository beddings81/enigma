# Enigma
#### By: Braxton Eddings


### Self Evaluation
- Functionality
  - I feel like my project meets the expectation for functionality. Both encrypt and decrypt command line interfaces are successfully implemented.

- Object Oriented Programming
  - I feel like my project went above expectations for OOP. I have impleted inheritance and a module. The module Shift made sense because it only holds behavior for the class Enigma, and it helps dry up the code. Class Enigma inherits from class Rotation because its needs access to all of the methods stored in rotation. I chose not to use a module because I wanted ever single test in Rotation to be tested at its lowest level. 

- Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  - I feel like I met the expectations for ruby conventions and mechanics. My code is properly indented and spaced. I used best choice enumerables, and followed naming conventions.

- Test Driven Development
  - I feel like I met the expectation for TDD. Every method is tested a unit/integration level. I addressed edge cases and git history should show I used TDD.

- Version Control
  - I feel like I met the expectations for version control. I made 115 commits and 12 pull request.
